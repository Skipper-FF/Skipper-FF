### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
After 25 years of professional experience in the tourism, hotel and sports sector, as a general manager, I was looking for a new life.
I therefore decided to engage in a professional reconversion process as a FullStack Web Developer and I integrated the #Batch-551 at Le wagon _ Paris, in January-March 2021.
The 9 weeks of training were dense, intense and rhythmic... that's why I chose Le Wagon!
These 9 weeks have also been a beautiful and rich human experience, with passionate, motivated and friendly people... an adventure shared on a daily basis and memories engraved forever!

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my next career as a Freelance FullStack Developper with a previous launching at the end of 2021.
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently & hardly learning my job by realizing few training months in a start'up and a web agency.
